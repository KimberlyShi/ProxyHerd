Your team has been asked to look into a different architecture called an "application server herd", where the multiple application servers communicate directly to each other as well as via the core database and caches. The interserver communications are designed for rapidly-evolving data (ranging from small stuff such as GPS-based locations to larger stuff such as ephemeral video data) whereas the database server will still be used for more stable data that is less-often accessed or that requires transactional semantics. For example, you might have three application servers A, B, C such that A talks with B and C but B and C do not talk to each other. However, the idea is that if a user's cell phone posts its GPS location to any one of the application servers then the other servers will learn of the location after one or two interserver transmissions, without having to talk to the database. Each server should accept TCP connections from clients that emulate mobile devices with IP addresses and DNS names. A client should be able to send its location to the server by sending a message.
